- 👋 Hi, I’m Tomás.
- 👀 I’m interested in the newest (ish) technologies. Mainly web oriented but I don't like closing any doors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NodeJS, Angular, Typescript, RXJS, and the list goes on, but right now focused on those technologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ambicious and fun projects. Specially if they give something to the world.
